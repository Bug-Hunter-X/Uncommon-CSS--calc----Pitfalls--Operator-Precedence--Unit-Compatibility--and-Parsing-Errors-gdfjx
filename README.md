# Uncommon CSS `calc()` Pitfalls

This repository demonstrates some less common issues that can arise when using the CSS `calc()` function.  The `calc()` function, while powerful for dynamic calculations within CSS, can be tricky if not used correctly.  This example highlights issues related to operator precedence, unit compatibility, and parsing errors.  The `bug.css` file shows examples of problematic code, while `bugSolution.css` offers corrected versions with explanations.

**Key Issues Covered:**

* **Operator Precedence:** Incorrect ordering of operations within the `calc()` function.
* **Unit Compatibility:** Combining incompatible units (e.g., pixels and percentages) in a way that leads to unexpected results.
* **Parsing Errors:**  Improper spacing and syntax in `calc()` expressions causing parsing failures.

Feel free to explore the code examples and learn how to avoid these pitfalls when using CSS `calc()`.
