The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations in CSS, but it can sometimes lead to unexpected results if not used carefully. One common error is incorrect operator precedence. For example, `width: calc(100% - 10px);` works correctly, but `width: calc(100% - 10px + 5%);` can lead to unexpected behavior, as the order of operations might not be what you expect.  Another issue arises when using `calc()` with units that aren't compatible. For example, `height: calc(100px + 10em);` is valid, but mixing different units can cause unexpected layouts, especially in complex scenarios. Additionally, if you use `calc()` within nested units, without proper space separation or correct operator usage, you might encounter parsing errors which leads to the CSS not being applied correctly. For instance, `margin:calc(10px+5%);` will produce an error, while `margin: calc(10px + 5%);` will work correctly.
